Psych UI made into a haxelib. All credits to Psych Engine team. 

## Installation

``` bash
haxelib git psych-ui https://github.com/Brainy0789/psych-ui
```

Copy the assets folder of this haxelib into your own source code, and then add something like this to your
Project.xml (or similar)
``` xml
<haxelib name="psych-ui">
<assets path="assets/embed" embed="true"/>
```

Not going to go over how to use it, as it's not really my code.
